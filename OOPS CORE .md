                Object-oriented programming (OOP)

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a fundamental paradigm in software development. It focuses on organizing code 
around "objects" which combine data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into self-contained units. This approach offers 
several benefits like modularity, reusability, and maintainability. Let's delve into the core concepts of OOP:

1. Objects:

Objects are the building blocks of OOP. They represent real-world entities like cars, customers, or bank accounts. 
Each object has:

* Attributes: These are variables that store the object's state, like a car's color, speed, or fuel level.

* Methods: These are functions that define the object's behavior, like a car's ability to accelerate, brake, or turn.

2. Classes:

* Classes are blueprints for creating objects. They define the attributes and methods that all instances of that class will have. 
This promotes code reuse and consistency.

3. Encapsulation:

* Encapsulation binds data and methods within an object, hiding its internal implementation details from the outside world. 
This protects the object's integrity and ensures data manipulation happens through controlled methods.

4. Abstraction:

* Abstraction focuses on exposing essential features of an object while hiding complex internal details. This simplifies 
the user's perspective, allowing them to interact with the object without needing to understand its intricacies.

5. Inheritance:

* Inheritance allows creating new classes (subclasses) based on existing ones (superclasses). Subclasses inherit 
attributes and methods from the superclass and can also add their own specialized behaviors. This promotes code reuse 
and avoids writing redundant code.

6. Polymorphism:

* Polymorphism allows objects of different types to respond to the same message (method call) in different ways. This enables flexible and dynamic behavior without needing to check object types explicitly.

Benefits of OOP:

* Modular code: Objects form independent units, making code easier to understand, maintain, and modify.

* Reusability: Classes and inheritance reduce code redundancy, promoting reuse across different parts of the program.

* Maintainability: Changes to objects are localized, minimizing the impact on other parts of the code.

* Scalability: OOP scales well for complex projects, as objects can be easily combined and organized into hierarchies.
